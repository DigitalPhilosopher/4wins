# Connect4

This is a project to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) for the famous perfect information game connect4. The code is written in python3 and utilizes tkinter for the graphical user interface. The AI algorithms used to solve the game are the MiniMax algorithm and the AlphaBetaPruning algorithm. Both algorithms use the same heuristic to define the state of the board.

## The game

"Connect Four" is a board game originaly puplished by  Milton Bradley in 1974 [1]. This is a two player game, similar to tic-tac-toe in which the players have full information about the game at every point. For that reason the game is a "perfect information" game.
<br />
Connect four has a field which has a length of 7 and a height of 6. The players choose in turns where to place their next piece, until one player has achieved to have four pieces in a row.
